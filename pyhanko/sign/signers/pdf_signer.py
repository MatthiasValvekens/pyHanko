            Bytes to reserve for the CMS object in the PDF file.
            If not specified, make an estimate based on a dummy signature.

                Since the CMS object is written to the output file as a
                hexadecimal string, you should request **twice** the (estimated)
                number of bytes in the DER-encoded version of the CMS object.
        :param validation_paths:
            If the validation path(s) for the TSA's certificate are already
            known, you can pass them using this parameter to avoid having to
            run the validation logic again.
        :param timestamper:
            Override the default :class:`.TimeStamper` associated with this
            :class:`.PdfTimeStamper`.
        :param output:
            Write the output to the specified output stream.
            If ``None``, write to a new :class:`.BytesIO` object.
            Default is ``None``.
        :param in_place:
            Sign the original input stream in-place.
            This parameter overrides ``output``.
        :param chunk_size:
            Size of the internal buffer (in bytes) used to feed data to the
            message digest function if the input stream does not support
            ``memoryview``.
        :param dss_settings:
            DSS output settings. See :class:`.TimestampDSSContentSettings`.
        :param tight_size_estimates:
            When estimating the size of a document timestamp container,
            do not add safety margins.

            .. note::
                External TSAs cannot be relied upon to always produce the
                exact same output length, which makes this option risky to use.
        :param embed_roots:
            Option that controls whether the root certificate of each validation
            path should be embedded into the DSS. The default is ``True``.

            .. note::
                Trust roots are configured by the validator, so embedding them
                typically does nothing in a typical validation process.
                Therefore they can be safely omitted in most cases.
                Nonetheless, embedding the roots can be useful for documentation
                purposes.
