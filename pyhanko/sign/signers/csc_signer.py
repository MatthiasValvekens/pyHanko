.. versionadded:: 0.10.0

Asynchronous :class:`~pyhanko.sign.signers.pdf_cms.Signer` implementation for
interacting with a remote signing service using the Cloud Signature Consortium
(CSC) API.

This implementation is based on version 1.0.4.0 (2019-06) of the CSC API
specification.


Usage notes
-----------

This module's :class:`.CSCSigner` class supplies an implementation of the
:class:`~pyhanko.sign.signers.pdf_cms.Signer` class in pyHanko.
As such, it is flexible enough to be used either through pyHanko's high-level
API (:func:`~pyhanko.sign.signers.functions.sign_pdf` et al.), or through
the :ref:`interrupted signing API <interrupted-signing>`.

:class:`.CSCSigner` overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`.CSCSigner` is only directly responsible for calling the
``signatures/signHash`` endpoint in the CSC API. Other than that, it only
handles batch control. This means that the following tasks require further
action on the API user's part:

 * authenticating to the signing service (typically using OAuth2);
 * obtaining Signature Activation Data (SAD) from the signing service;
 * provisioning the certificates to embed into the document (usually
   those are supplied by the signing service as well).

The first two involve a degree of implementation/vendor dependence that is
difficult to cater to in full generality, and the third is out of scope
for :class:`~pyhanko.sign.signers.pdf_cms.Signer` subclasses in general.

However, this module still provides a number of convenient hooks and guardrails
that should allow you to fill in these blanks with relative ease. We briefly
discuss these below.

Throughout, the particulars of how pyHanko should connect to a signing
service are supplied in a :class:`.CSCServiceSessionInfo` object.
This object contains the base CSC API URL, the CSC credential ID to use,
and authentication data.


Authenticating to the signing service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the authentication process itself is the API user's responsibility,
:class:`.CSCServiceSessionInfo` includes an
:attr:`~.CSCServiceSessionInfo.oauth_token` field that will (by default)
be used to populate the HTTP ``Authorization`` header for every request.

To handle OAuth-specific tasks, you might want to use a library like
`OAuthLib <https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Obtaining SAD from the signing service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is done by subclassing :class:`.CSCAuthorizationInfo` and passing
an instance to the :class:`.CSCSigner`. The :class:`.CSCAuthorizationInfo`
instance should call the signer's ``credentials/authorize`` endpoint with
the proper parameters required by the service.
See the documentation for :class:`.CSCAuthorizationInfo` for details and=
information about helper functions.


Certificate provisioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In pyHanko's API, :class:`~pyhanko.sign.signers.pdf_cms.Signer` instances
need to be initialised with the signer's certificate, preferably together
with other relevant CA certificates.
In a CSC context, these are typically retrieved from the signing service by
calling the ``credentials/info`` endpoint.

This module offers a helper function to handle that task, see
:func:`.fetch_certs_in_csc_credential`.
