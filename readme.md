## Documentation

[*certvalidator* documentation](docs/readme.md)

## Continuous Integration

Various combinations of platforms and versions of Python are tested via:

 - [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wbond/certvalidator/history)
 - [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/wbond/certvalidator)
 - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/wbond/certvalidator/actions)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/wbond/certvalidator/builds)

## Testing

Tests are written using `unittest` and require no third-party packages.

Depending on what type of source is available for the package, the following
commands can be used to run the test suite.

### Git Repository

When working within a Git working copy, or an archive of the Git repository,
the full test suite is run via:

```bash
python run.py tests
```

To run only some tests, pass a regular expression as a parameter to `tests`.

```bash
python run.py tests path
```

### PyPi Source Distribution

When working within an extracted source distribution (aka `.tar.gz`) from
PyPi, the full test suite is run via:

```bash
python setup.py test
```

### Test Cases

The test cases for the library are comprised of:

 - [Public Key Interoperability Test Suite from NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/pki/pkitesting.html)
 - [OCSP tests from OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/test/recipes/80-test_ocsp.t)
 - Various certificates generated for TLS certificate validation

## Development

To install the package used for linting, execute:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/lint
```

The following command will run the linter:

```bash
python run.py lint
```

Support for code coverage can be installed via:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/coverage
```

Coverage is measured by running:

```bash
python run.py coverage
```

To install the packages requires to generate the API documentation, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/api_docs
```

The documentation can then be generated by running:

```bash
python run.py api_docs
```

The following will run a test that connects to all (non-adult) sites in the
Alexa top 1000 that respond on port 443:

```bash
python run.py stress_test
```

Once the script is complete, results that differ between the OS validation and
the *certvalidator* validation will be listed for further debugging.

To change the version number of the package, run:

```bash
python run.py version {pep440_version}
```

To install the necessary packages for releasing a new version on PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/release
```

Releases are created by:

 - Making a git tag in [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#examples-of-compliant-version-schemes) format
 - Running the command:

   ```bash
   python run.py release
   ```

Existing releases can be found at https://pypi.org/project/certvalidator.

## CI Tasks

A task named `deps` exists to ensure a modern version of `pip` is installed,
along with all necessary testing dependencies.

The `ci` task runs `lint` (if flake8 is avaiable for the version of Python) and
`coverage` (or `tests` if coverage is not available for the version of Python).
If the current directory is a clean git working copy, the coverage data is
submitted to codecov.io.

```bash
python run.py deps
python run.py ci
```
