# certvalidator
Forked from [wbond/certvalidator](https://github.com/wbond/certvalidator), with patches for [pyHanko](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko).

A Python library for validating X.509 certificates or paths. Supports various
options, including: validation at a specific moment in time, whitelisting and
revocation checks.

## Current Release

![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyhanko-certvalidator.svg) - [changelog](changelog.md)

## Dependencies

 - *asn1crypto*
 - *cryptography*
 - *uritools*
 - *oscrypto*
 - *requests* or *aiohttp* (use the latter for more efficient asyncio, requires resource management)
 - Python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9

 ### Note on compatibility

 Starting with `pyhanko-certvalidator` version `0.17.0`, the library has been refactored to use asynchronous I/O as much as possible. Most high-level API entrypoints can still be used synchronously, but have been deprecated in favour of their asyncio equivalents. 
 As part of this move, the OCSP and CRL clients now have two separate implementations: a `requests`-based one, and an `aiohttp`-based one. The latter is probably more performant, but requires more resource management efforts on the caller's part, which was impossible to implement without making major breaking changes to the public API that would make the migration path more complicated. Therefore, the `requests`-based fetcher will remain the default for the time being.

 NOTE: version `0.17.0` has not been released yet, details will be in the change log.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyhanko-certvalidator
```

## License

*certvalidator* is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. See the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the exact license text.

## Documentation

[*certvalidator* documentation](docs/readme.md)

## Continuous Integration

Various combinations of platforms and versions of Python are tested via:

 - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/certvalidator/actions)

## Testing

Tests are written using `unittest` and require no third-party packages.

Depending on what type of source is available for the package, the following
commands can be used to run the test suite.

### Git Repository

When working within a Git working copy, or an archive of the Git repository,
the full test suite is run via:

```bash
python run.py tests
```

To run only some tests, pass a regular expression as a parameter to `tests`.

```bash
python run.py tests path
```

### PyPi Source Distribution

When working within an extracted source distribution (aka `.tar.gz`) from
PyPi, the full test suite is run via:

```bash
python setup.py test
```

### Test Cases

The test cases for the library are comprised of:

 - [Public Key Interoperability Test Suite from NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/pki/pkitesting.html)
 - [OCSP tests from OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/test/recipes/80-test_ocsp.t)
 - Various certificates generated for TLS certificate validation

## Development

To install the package used for linting, execute:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/lint
```

The following command will run the linter:

```bash
python run.py lint
```

To install the packages requires to generate the API documentation, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/api_docs
```

The documentation can then be generated by running:

```bash
python run.py api_docs
```

The following will run a test that connects to all (non-adult) sites in the
Alexa top 1000 that respond on port 443:

```bash
python run.py stress_test
```

Once the script is complete, results that differ between the OS validation and
the *certvalidator* validation will be listed for further debugging.

To change the version number of the package, run:

```bash
python run.py version {pep440_version}
```

To install the necessary packages for releasing a new version on PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/release
```

Releases are created by:

 - Making a git tag in [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#examples-of-compliant-version-schemes) format
 - Running the command:

   ```bash
   python run.py release
   ```

Existing releases can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pyhanko-certvalidator.
