API reference
*************

This is the API reference for pyHanko, compiled from the docstrings present in
the Python source files. For a more high-level overview, see the
:ref:`library user guide <lib-user-guide>`.
If you are interested in using pyHanko as a command-line application, please
refer to the :ref:`CLI user guide <cli-user-guide>`.


.. warning::
    Any function, class or method that is *not* covered by this documentation
    is considered private API by definition.

    Until pyHanko goes into beta, *any* part of the API is subject to
    change without notice, but this applies doubly to the undocumented parts.
    Tread with caution.
