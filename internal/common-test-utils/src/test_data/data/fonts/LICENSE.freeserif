This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

Clarification of exception, regarding intended use of embedded fonts

The exception to the GNU General Public License for the GNU FreeFont software exempts a user that embeds part or all of the GNU FreeFont software in a document, as well as subsequent users and distributors of the document, from complying with the GNU GPL under some circumstances.

Specifically, this exemption applies when the embedder has not modified the GNU FreeFont software before embedding it. This is true even though portions of the software become part of the document.

Therefore users of fonts released with this exception need not concern themselves with the license terms to:

    Create a printable file using the fonts.
    Publish such a file.
    Redistribute such a file.
    Publicly display such a file.
    Print such a file or display it on the screen.

However anyone distributing the font software as software separately from the document, even if the way the font software was obtained was to extract it from a document, would have to comply with the GNU GPL.

A modified version of the GNU FreeFont software must comply with the GNU GPL. It may optionally carry the same exception as the GNU FreeFont software itself, and we recommend releasing modified versions that way. If it does, then users will likewise be permitted to embed the modified version in documents and be exempt from the GNU GPL requirements on those documents.
